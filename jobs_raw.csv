We wanted to make snacks nutritious, and we did so in the most delicious way. Before our frozen range we noticed snacks like momos, burgers, and crispy nuggets are often full of artificial preservatives and unhealthy ingredients. So, with innovation and creativity, we gave an egg remix to juicy anda bhurji momos, egg burger patties, and crispy egg nuggets. We believe this is the best way to ensure healthy snacking for both adults and kids.
